#  VISHGUARD: A Multilingual Dataset for Persuasion-Sensitive Voice Phishing Detection

##  Overview

**VISHGUARD** is a multilingual, synthetic audio corpus designed to advance research in **voice phishing (vishing) detection**, **behavioral analysis**, and **speech-based social engineering defense**.  
It represents one of the first publicly available benchmarks to combine **linguistic**, **acoustic**, **emotional**, and **persuasion-related** features for **multilingual voice threat analysis**.

##  Abstract

Voice phishing (vishing) has become a leading vector for social engineering attacks, exploiting psychological manipulation using speech to deceive victims.  
Despite growing interest in voice threat detection, current public datasets remain limited to a single language, lack behavioral realism, and neglect the linguistic and persuasive indices that define fraudulent speech.  

This paper presents **VISHGUARD**, a multilingual synthetic audio corpus designed to support research on **persuasion-sensitive vishing detection**.  
The dataset comprises **3,000 simulated phone calls** in **English, French, and Arabic**, equally divided between **fraudulent and legitimate** categories.  

Each sample is annotated across multiple dimensions, including:
- **Persuasion patterns:** authority, scarcity, urgency, reward, threat  
- **Behavioral traits:** interruptions, irregular speech, long silences  
- **Emotional tone:** neutral, anxious, calm, manipulative  

Audio samples are generated using a reproducible pipeline of **speech synthesis** and **noise injection**, integrating realistic ambient sounds from office, street, and home environments to simulate natural communication conditions.  
Durations range from **10 to 90 seconds**, providing controlled variability in linguistic structure and acoustic complexity.  

Comprehensive validation confirms the balance between languages, classes, and annotations.  
By bridging the gap between **linguistic psychology** and **speech-based cybersecurity**, **VISHGUARD** provides a **reproducible benchmark** for the development and evaluation of **multilingual vishing detection systems**.
